## GUI for Registers & Data Memory 

### Problem
* The registers [x0 to x31] in RV32 ISA are loaded with data to be operated upon. This is the internal memory of the Processor.
* For testing or simulation, these registers were required to be manually entered and initiated in the Verilog code which was a tedious task.

### Solution
* I have developed a Python based Graphical user interface and changed the way the register files are loaded and initialized in the verilog code.
* The verilog code now uses the $readmemh function to read a reg_load.hex file into all 32 registers.
* The reg_load.hex file is generated by the GUI by default in the following manner:
```
@00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
.
.
.
00000000
```
* This is the default file format.
* The @00000000 shows the starting address of the instructions.
* The next line is the data to be entered into the x0 register, the 2nd line is entered in the x1 register and so on...
* When the python GUI is run, you get a window popup as follows: 
* ![Alt text](/getting_started/images/gui.png)
* The register configuration can be done from this terminal, and the saved file should be in the main directory where all the verilog modules of the core are loacted.
* The name of the file should always be "reg_load.hex" since that is programmed in the verilog file for registers.
* The file generated when 2 -> x2 and 3-> x3 is as follows 
```
@00000000
00000000
00000000
00000002
00000003
00000000
00000000
``` 

# Step by step implementation and progress.
* Module files were written.
* Top file is completed.
* Instantiating PC and PC_adder.
* ![Alt text](/getting_started/images/image.png)
* Instructions are properly read out of the instructions.hex file.
  
The test code is as follows for the add instruction datapath test.
Instructions: 
```
add x5,x1,x2 # add contents of reg x1 and x2, store result x5
add x5,x3,x5 # add contents of reg x3 and x5, store result x5
add x5,x4,x5 # add contents of reg x4 and x5, store result x5
```
Machine code

```
0x002082B3
0x005182B3
0x005202B3
```
Inside instructions.hex 
```
@00000000
002082B3
005182B3
005202B3
```

* The Add istruction works well, only that Data is not being written into the register, since WE is off.
* ![Alt text](/getting_started/images/image-2.png)
* After adding WE, this is resolved.
* ![Alt text](/getting_started/images/image-3.png)
* added controller(with decoder functionality embedded directly)
* ![Alt text](/getting_started/images/image-4.png)
* added sub instruction capability as well

* Now moving on to other R type instructions of RV32I
* using funct3 to add all those instructions support. Changes will have to be made to ALU and Controller modules.
* Thats done. R type instructions are now supported on my core(sra left).

# Test for LW instruction

```
![Alt text](/getting_started/images/image-10.png)

## explanaition
```
lw x6, 7(x7)
```
* The instruction wants to read data memory.
* Address of data memory to read = [data of register x7 + immediate(7 in this case)]. = 3 + 7 = 10;
* Note: data memory position 7 was loaded with value 3.
* Now the register x6 is loaded with the value from data memories 10th position. (in this case x10 = 0xE).
* The addi,x6,x6,0 is used to check value stored in x6, which is correctly found as E.
* Thus lw is verified.
* similarly tests for :
* lh x6, 7(x7) 
* ![Alt text](/getting_started/images/image-11.png)
